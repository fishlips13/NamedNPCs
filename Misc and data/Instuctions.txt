BepInEx 5.3 and NamedNPCs 1.0
-----------------------------


What is this?
-------------
BepInEx 5.3 pre-bundled with NamedNPCs 1.0
BepInEx is a mod framework for Unity based games. It allows modification of Unity games without editing the base game.
NamedNPCs is a mod for the game Streets of Rogue that randomly renames characters in game based on a provided list.


Installing
----------
0. (Optional) Backup your Streets of Rogue installation, 'steamapps/common/Streets of Rogue'. This folder does not contain your save data.
1. Copy these files into the Streets of Rogue top level directory (the folder containing 'StreetsOfRogue.exe').
2. Run the game once to complete setup.


Uninstalling
------------
Delete the 'BepInEx' folder, 'doorstop_config.ini' and 'winhttp.dll' from 'steamapps/common/Streets of Rogue'.
To uninstall just NamedNPCs, delete the 'NamedNPCs' folder from 'BepInEx\plugins'.
BepInEx and NamedNPCs do not directly modify game files. No other changes are necessary.
If in doubt, verify your game files through Steam.


Usage
-----
NPCs in game will be named randomly and automatically.
The number of named NPCs can be altered via the configuration.
Most names are based on the list of names provided, 'BepInEx\plugins\NamedNPCs\names.txt'.
Some special cases are defined in 'BepInEx\plugins\NamedNPCs\config.cfg'.


Configuration
-------------
Configuration is handled outside the game through the config file, 'BepInEx\plugins\NamedNPCs\config.cfg'.
See the config file for more information on the various available settings.


Compatability
-----------
NamedNPCs is build for single player only. While multiple players can install the mod, names will not synchronize between players.
This may be addressed in a future version.
NamedNPCs is compatible with Streets of Rogue 91c. Other versions may work but your mileage may vary.
