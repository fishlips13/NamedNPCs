NamedNPCs
-----------------------------
NamedNPCs is a mod for the game Streets of Rogue that randomly renames characters in game based on a provided list.
It is based on BepInEx, a mod framework for Unity based games


Usage
-----
NPCs in game will be named randomly and automatically.
The number of named NPCs can be altered via the configuration.
Most names are based on the list of names provided, 'BepInEx\plugins\NamedNPCs\names.txt'.
Some special cases are defined in 'BepInEx\plugins\NamedNPCs\config.cfg'.
Dialogue lines tied to names can also be replaced, also defiend in 'BepInEx\plugins\NamedNPCs\names.txt'.


Configuration
-------------
Configuration is handled outside the game through the config file, 'BepInEx\plugins\NamedNPCs\config.cfg'.
See the config file for more information on the various available settings.


Compatability
-----------
NamedNPCs is build for single player only. While multiple players can install the mod, names will not synchronize between players.
This may be addressed in a future version.
NamedNPCs is compatible with Streets of Rogue 91c. Other versions may work but your mileage may vary.
